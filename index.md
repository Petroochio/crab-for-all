# Farewell to Arms ...and Legs

### Description

In the world of gaming and robotics, there are many examples of one or multiple robots being controlled by a single user.  However, there are far fewer that explore multiple users operating a single entity.  Farewell to Arms ...and Legs is a crab-like creature with four, two-jointed legs articulated by a servo motor at each joint. Four identical legs with potentiometers, instead of  servos, at each joint are mounted to a board and serve as individual controllers by mapping the incoming data to the servo motors on the crab. The applications of this concept are not limited to just entertainment. We envision similar projects that can be used to help develop on team work or communication skills, or more detailed recreations of actual methods of animal locomotion.
